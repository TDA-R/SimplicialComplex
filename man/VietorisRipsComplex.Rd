\title{Construct a Vietoris–Rips Complex (1-skeleton + maximal simplices)}
\usage{
VietorisRipsComplex(points, epsilon)
}
\arguments{
\item{points}{A numeric matrix or data.frame with one point per row (columns are coordinates).}

\item{epsilon}{A positive numeric threshold; connect points with distance < \eqn{\epsilon}.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\describe{
  \item{network}{An \code{igraph} object representing the 1-skeleton.}
  \item{simplices}{A list of integer vectors, each the vertex indices of a maximal simplex.}
}
}
\description{
Builds the 1-skeleton graph by connecting pairs of points whose Euclidean
distance is strictly less than \eqn{\epsilon}, then extracts maximal cliques
as maximal simplices.
}
\details{
The Vietoris–Rips complex at scale \eqn{\epsilon} includes a simplex for every
finite set of points with pairwise distances < \eqn{\epsilon}. This function
constructs the 1-skeleton (edges only) and then uses maximal cliques in that
graph as the maximal simplices.
