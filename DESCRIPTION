Description: Provides an implementation of simplicial complexes for 
    Topological Data Analysis (TDA). The package includes functions to 
    compute faces, boundary operators, Betti numbers, Euler characteristic, 
    and to construct simplicial complexes. It also implements persistent 
    homology, from building filtrations to computing persistence diagrams, 
    with the aim of helping readers understand the core concepts of 
    computational topology.
    Methods are based on standard references in persistent homology such as 
    Zomorodian and Carlsson (2005) <doi:10.1007/s00454-004-1146-y> and 
    Chazal and Michel (2021) <doi:10.3389/frai.2021.667963>.
